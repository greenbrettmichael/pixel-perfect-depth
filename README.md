This work presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model with pixel-space diffusion transformers. Compared to existing discriminative and generative models, 
its estimated depth maps can produce high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds.

*Overview of Pixel-Perfect Depth. We perform diffusion generation directly in pixel space without using any VAE.* 

## 🌟 Features

* Pixel-space diffusion generation (operating directly in image space, without VAE or latent representations), capable of producing flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps.
* Our network architecture is purely Transformer-based, containing no convolutional layers.
* Although our model is trained at a fixed resolution of 1024×768, it can flexibly support various input resolutions and aspect ratios during inference.

## News
- **2024-10-01:** Paper, project page, code, models, and demo are all released.

## Pre-trained Models

Our pretrained models are available on the huggingface hub:

| Model | Params | Checkpoint | Training Resolution |
|:-|-:|:-:|:-:|
| PPD-Large | 500M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/gangweix/Pixel-Perfect-Depth/resolve/main/ppd.pth) | 1024×768 |

## Usage

### Prepraration

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gangweix/pixel-perfect-depth
cd pixel-perfect-depth
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download our pretrained model [ppd.pth](https://huggingface.co/gangweix/Pixel-Perfect-Depth/resolve/main/ppd.pth) and put it under the `checkpoints/` directory.
In addition, you also need to download the pretrained model [depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Large/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth?download=true) and put it under the `checkpoints/` directory.

### Running depth on *images*

```bash
python run.py 
```

### Running point cloud on *images*

Generating point clouds requires metric depth and camera intrinsics from MoGe.
Please download the pretrained model [moge2.pt](https://huggingface.co/Ruicheng/moge-2-vitl-normal/resolve/main/model.pt?download=true) and place it under the `checkpoints/` folder.

```bash
python run_point_cloud.py --save_pcd
```

## Qualitative Comparisons with Previous Methods

Our model preserves more fine-grained details than Depth Anything v2 and MoGe 2, while demonstrating significantly higher robustness compared to Depth Pro.
